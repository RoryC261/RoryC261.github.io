    <td>The new installment in the very popluar Call of Duty franchise, known as Black Ops Cold War, had released on the 13th of November of this year.<br>
      <br> 
    Fans of the series have come to the game hoping to get their hands on a revamped experience with the franchise, with the game's setting taking place after the original Black Ops game in the campaign and the story having themes of trust and interpretation.<br>
    <br>   
    Black Ops Cold War has taken some notes from what was said about last year's installment Modern Warfare (2019) and has returned to more formulaic map design. On top of this it has taken inspiration from Modern Warfare's Gunsmith for the player's loadout customization.<br>
    <br>
    The new installment has brought back the fan favourite Zombies mode and taking the gamemode in Cold War back to the older style of the survival co-op but also adds what the zombies mode has built up on with more optional objectives and more unique weapons to choose from.

    Apex Legends is a free to play, fast paced Battle Royale game created by Respawn Entertainment.<br>
    <br>
    The game has had a new season of content added to it this month, which the devs are calling "Season 7: Ascension". This season brings a whole new map to the game named "Olympus", set in a floating city which adds a whole host of new game elements. This includes a portal in the middle of the map that players can run through to traverse the map quicker, as well as this there are vehichle called the "Trident" in the game for the first time which all three members of a squad can jump on and ride together with the map providing routes and jumps players can use to their advantage.<br>
    <br>
    This season also brings a new legend for players to unlock: Horzion. She is described as "A brilliant astrophysicist" who has the special ability to create black holes which drag enemies towards it and trap them and she also has the ability to change gravity within an area to give her and her squadmates an ariel advantage over her foes. <br>
    <br>
    As found in the previous seasons of the game, there is a new optional battle pass in the game which players can buy to unlock extra cosmetics for their legends which are themed accordingly with the new map and content. The Ranked playlist has also been reset so players will have to regain their ranks previously achieved in previous seasons. The game also introduces the Clubs feature which allows players to create communities and clans within the game.<br>
    <br>
    Apex Legends is now available on the Steam store and those that have previously only had the game on Origin can now download and install the game via Steam and have all their data transferred from Origin.
